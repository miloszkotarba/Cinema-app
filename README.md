# Cinema Management API ðŸŽ¦
The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive cinema management system that not only streamlines operations but also enhances the user experience through an intuitive interface and automation.

This project is a backend API for managing cinema operations, developed using Express.js and MongoDB. It serves as a valuable tool for handling essential cinema data, including pricing, movie schedules, theater settings, and film management. 

This project is part of my self-development journey, as I aim to deepen my skills in backend development. To complement the backend, I have created a user-friendly frontend using Vue.js, enhancing the overall functionality and experience of the application.

## Features

- **Movie Schedules:** Manage the cinema's repertoire, including showtimes and availability for each screening.
- **Pricing Management:** Set and update ticket prices.
- **Theater Configuration:** Set up and manage cinema halls and seating arrangements.
- **Movie Management:** Add, update, or delete movies from the database.
- **Automated Tagging:** During the retrieval of movie data (via GET movie), tags are automatically generated by the LLM (Google Gemini). This feature not only ensures that movies are easily categorized by themes and genres but also provides me with an opportunity to experiment with a language model, deepening my understanding of its capabilities.
- **Reservation Handling:** Upon confirming a reservation, the system generates confirmation emails for users, providing them with all necessary details about their booking. After a successful booking, invoices are also automatically generated. Users have the option to change reservation details or cancel their bookings, ensuring flexibility and convenience.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
